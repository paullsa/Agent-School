    "### LangChain Vectorstore RAG Implementation\n",
    "---\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using LangChain with local models via Ollama. The implementation follows a multi-step reasoning process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup**: Loads two Ollama models (phi4-mini for reasoning and Gemma3:1b for synthesis) to handle different parts of the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Question Analysis**: Uses the reasoning model to break down complex questions into logical sub-steps that can be individually researched.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Document Processing**: Loads a local text corpus about space exploration, splits it into manageable chunks, and creates vector embeddings using the nomic-embed-text model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Knowledge Retrieval**: For each identified reasoning step, performs a similarity search in the Chroma vectorstore to find the most relevant information from the knowledge base.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Answer Synthesis**: Feeds the original question and all retrieved contextual information to the synthesis model, which generates a cohesive, factual response.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach enhances the quality of AI-generated answers by combining structured reasoning with targeted information retrieval from a domain-specific knowledge base, allowing for more accurate and contextually relevant responses than using an LLM alone."
